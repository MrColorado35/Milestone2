# Tatry Mountains by Stan Kaczorkiewicz


The main purpose of this project is to practice my JavaScript coding, among with the jQuery and external APIs,
that will make my website more attractive for the user.

The reason why I decided to choose that subject is, that in my opinion Tatry mountains are not known enough 
across the world, yet they are really beautiful.

My first idea was to locate pictures on one the left side of the page, map on the middle and all the text on the right.
While creating, however, I realized it looks nicer if I'll use carousele and set the pictures on top of the page.


I had to abadon this project in order to focus on the rest of the bootcamp, but I'm going to come back to it around November 2020.

I'll keep it updated.

Stay safe!
