# Milestone Project 2, Tatry Mountains by Stan Kaczorkiewicz



This is my second milestone project I'm doing as a part of Front-end developer course with The Code Institute.
The main purpose of this project is to practice my JavaScript coding, among with the jQuery and other tools,
that will make my website more attractive for the user.

The reason why I decided to choose that subject is, that in my opinion Tatry mountains are not known enough 
across the world, yet they are really beautiful.

Here I was trying to paste my wireframe made in balsamiq, but for some reason it doesn't want to cooperate.

I'll keep it updated.

Stay safe!
