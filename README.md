# Milestone Project 2, Tatry Mountains by Stan Kaczorkiewicz



This is my second milestone project I'm doing as a part of Front-end developer course with The Code Institute.
The main purpose of this project is to practice my JavaScript coding, among with the jQuery and other tools,
that will make my website more attractive for the user.

The reason why I decided to choose that subject is, that in my opinion Tatry mountains are not known enough 
across the world, yet they are really beautiful.

My first idea was to locate pictures on one the left side of the page, map on the middle and all the text on the right.
While creating, however, I realized it looks nicer if I'll use carousele and set the pictures on top of the page.


I'll keep it updated.

Stay safe!
