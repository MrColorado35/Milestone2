Welcome MrColorado35,

This is the Code Institute student template for Gitpod. We have preinstalled all of the tools you need to get started. You can safely delete this README.md file, or change it for your own project.

## Gitpod Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A blue button should appear to click: *Make Public*,

Another blue button should appear to click: *Open Browser*.

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A blue button should appear to click: *Make Public*,

Another blue button should appear to click: *Open Browser*.

In Gitpod you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the backend lessons.

## Updates Since The Instructional Video

We continually tweak and adjust this template to help give you the best experience. Here are the updates since the original video was made:

**February 2020:** The initialisation files now _do not_ auto-delete. They will remain in your project. You can safely ignore them. They just make sure that your workspace is configured correctly each time you open it. It will also prevent the Gitpod configuration popup from appearing.

**December 2019:** Added Eventyret's Bootstrap 4 extension. Type `!bscdn` in a HTML file to add the Bootstrap boilerplate. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/Eventyret/vscode-bcdn" target="_blank">README.md file at the official repo</a> for more options.

Happy coding!


#Milestone Project 2, Tatry Mountains by Stan Kaczorkiewicz

This is my second milestone project I'm doing as a part of Front-end developer course with The Code Institute.
The main purpose of this project is to practice my JavaScript coding, among with the jQuery and other tools,
that will make my website more attractive for the user.

The reason why I decided to choose that subject is, that in my opinion Tatry mountains are not known enough 
across the world, yet they are really beautiful.

Here I was trying to paste my wireframe made in balsamiq, but for some reason it doesn't want to cooperate.

I'll keep it updated.

Stay safe!
